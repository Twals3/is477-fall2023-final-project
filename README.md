### Overview
# In this project, I am combining the various methods of data management, curation, and reproducability learning throughout this course. The data I am using is the wine popular dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The wine data are results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. This project covers everything from checking the intergrity of the data and preforming analysis on it to managing the environment and communicating the requirements needed to reproduce the findings. It is important to actively seek improvement for the quality and usability of our data, something that this project encourages. 

### Analysis
# In my analysis section, I complete basic descriptive functions that tell someone more about the data they are working with, as well as display the relationshipo between the concentration of Proanthocyanins and Flavanoids in wine. There is a high correlation between the two constituents. Although this cannot be used as a clear indication of causation, the correlation is relatively high, being above .65.
